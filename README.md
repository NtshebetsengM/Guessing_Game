# Guessing Game

This is my first project built in C#. It is a simple number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 0 and 10, 100, or 1000, and the player must guess the number. The game gives feedback on whether the player's guess is too low or too high, and it keeps track of the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

## Features

- A random number is generated based on a difficulty level.
- Players input their guesses, and the game will give feedback whether their guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- The number of attempts is tracked, and the player is shown how many attempts it took to guess the correct number.
- Input validation ensures that only numbers are accepted as guesses.

## How to Play

1. The game will ask you to choose your difficulty.
2. Depending on what you choose, you will get a range to guess between.
3. After each guess, you will be told whether your guess is too high or too low.
4. Keep guessing until you guess the correct number.
5. Once you guess correctly, the game will tell you how many attempts it took.

## Requirements

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or any C# compatible IDE)
- .NET Framework (or .NET Core for cross-platform compatibility)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/guessing-game.git
   
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE).
